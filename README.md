## 🚀 How It Works

The launcher starts Genshin Impact in suspended mode, injects `Genshin.Fps.UnlockerIsland.dll` via `LoadLibraryW`, and resumes the process. The DLL modifies memory to:

- Unlock FPS limit
- Modify camera FOV
- Remove fog-related rendering flags

## 📦 Usage

1. Download the injector and DLL.
2. Ensure `GenshinImpact.exe` or `YuanShen.exe` is available.
3. Run the launcher:
   - Game path will be read from an `.ini` file or selected manually.
   - The launcher starts the game suspended.
   - Injects the DLL using LoadLibrary.
   - Resumes the game.
4. Use `Insert` key to toggle the in-game overlay.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- Game path is saved to a `.ini` file after first selection.
- DLL must be in the same folder as the launcher executable.
